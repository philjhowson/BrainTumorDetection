                trainable and overall, but also due to the fact that it was able to
                benefit from transfer learning. The model is also significantly
                more lightweight compared to ResNet (49 MB vs. 359 MB), and
                while ResNet had the same advantages with transfer learning,
                DenseNet still outperformed it. With more hyperparameter
